**1.** Files that begin with month names (i.e., jan, feb, or mar) are essentially lecture notes and demonstrate what I can do in R.

**2.** Files that begin with "lab" are examples of laboratories (i.e., graded assignments) that I successfully completed during the course.

**3.** Lastly, files named "midterm" and "final" are exams in which I didn't quite write down each question, but my completed work is still there to demonstrate my coding abilities in R under time pressure, with notes, and without internet assistance.
